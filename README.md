# PA-COVID-19-DB4480
A COVID-19 database that keeps track of Coronavirus cases in the state of Pennsylvania. Uniquely identified by a case number, confirmed cases should have information about the patient, location, caregiver, and outcome. For each patient, information such as their name, date-of-birth, Social Security Number, presence of preexisting health conditions, and age is included. Patients may or may not have a listed caregiver due to those who are not hospitalized. Each county of Pennsylvania is included in this database along with information regarding FIPS code, population, confirmed cases, death count, and social-distancing grade.
